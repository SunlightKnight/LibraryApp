This app was created by SunlightKnight, IronTunder, and OssidoFerrico.
It was developed as a test project for a three-week internship program proposed by our school.

When we started creating this app, we only had the project outline provided by our tutor (SunlightKnight). From there, we began working on the app, learning step by step from the React Native Documentation (https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

This app uses two APIs from OpenLibrary (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api): one for fetching book details and another for retrieving book covers based on the information provided.

After implementing the basic functions, we integrated a REST API database from JSONBin.io to enable the data-saving system required for managing different user accounts within the app.

For the aesthetic aspects of the project, we used ChatGPT and DeepSeek to help refine and enhance various elements.

We hope you enjoy using our app.
Have a great time! ;)
